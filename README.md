=============

I re-built the Twitter home page as a fun code exercise. This page is entirely front-end, so refreshing the page clears all data. 
Tools used: HTML, Javascript/Jqeury, CSS/Bootstrap. 

Build a simplified single-page version of something like the Twitter Home page, which should:
1.  Have an input box + submit button at the top that allows a user to enter new status messages
2. Upon submission, insert the latest message at the top of an area below the input box (the user should be able to enter as many messages as they want)
3. Restrict the user input to 140 characters
4. Show the user's avatar, message, timestamp, and a few action links (like Favorite and Reply) on
each message the
timestamp and links don't have to do anything or be dynamic, they can just
be styled text, and the avatar is obviously just static
5. Be a single page with no back end refreshing
the page obviously clears everything out
6. Be styled as if you were going to deploy this to Twitter or Facebook pretend you're building this as if it would be shown on a live site immediately to millions of users.
